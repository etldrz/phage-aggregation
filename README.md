# phage-aggregation

Contains code, plotting data, and plots for the phage-aggregation project

## TODO
- Make sure that all matrices are encoded to txt the same way, for the purposes of preprocessed/rStar
- Places where the switch from net fecundity to W_A/B could give me trouble: findLyseFitness, the return value of slopeEqual
- Should assumptions for bootstrapping be talked about?
- $E(W_S)$
