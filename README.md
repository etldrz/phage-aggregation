# phage-aggregation

Contains code, plotting data, and plots for the phage-aggregation project

## TODO

- Nothing is done with swap counts, they just become attributes of the returned matrix
- What to do when $\theta = 0$
- Make sure that all matrices are encoded to txt the same way, for the purposes of preprocessed/rStar
